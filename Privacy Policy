# Natural Palette Privacy Policy

Protecting your private information is a paramount priority for us. This Statement of Privacy applies to the Natural Palette app and governs data collection and usage. By using the Natural Palette app, you, “the user”, consent to the data practices described in this statement.
Collection of your Personal Information

We do not collect any personal information. We only store essential information, such as the player’s progress through the game.
Security of your Personal Information

Natural Palette protects the user’s data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure through systems provided by Apple.
Opt-Out & Deletion of Data

Natural Palette does not retain user data after it has been deleted by the user. Deleting the Brainy Phonics app from the iOS device destroys all references to the user’s data.
